# Number of Triangles in a graph

- Current Issue: Map Reduce is incomplete

- Requirements:
Python 2.7

- Execute:

```
python triangles.py <file_path>
```

- Example:

```
python triangles.py sample.csv
```

- Output:

```
Number of vertices = 3
===========================
Applying Brute Force Method
===========================
Number of triangles = 1
Total number of computations (complexity) = 7
===============================================
Applying Matrix Multiplication and Trace Method
===============================================
Number of triangles = 1
Total number of computations (complexity) = 57
